    <p>Hey there.</p>
    <p>For security reasons we've started to sign our packages using GPG, like arch already does for their repos.<br />
    You can get the needed <a href="http://bbqlinux.org/master-key/" target="_blank">public keys</a> by installing the "bbqlinux-keyring" package from our repos.</p>

    <p>To make pacman only trusting signed packages the required change to your pacman config would look like this:<br />
    <a href="https://github.com/bbqlinux/bbqiso/commit/74fc8d4e8fe569580f38ba297fad6ad21f5e3589" target="_blank">https://github.com/bbqlinux/bbqiso/commit/74fc8d4e8fe569580f38ba297fad6ad21f5e3589</a><br />
    (remove "SigLevel = Optional TrustAll" from the bbqlinux repo entry)</p>
